# Akka.Skeleton
## What is this?
Akka.Skeleton is a barebones setup of [Akka .Net](https://google.com). I created this so it's easier to start from scratch when using Akka .Net. It's just what's needed to run an Actor System, so anyone can just start coding. 

## Included
- [X] Logging (with Serilog)
- [X] Actor

## To-Do
- [] Akka.Skeleton.Persistence
- [] Akka.Skeleton.Cluster
- [] Akka.Skeleton.UnitTests
